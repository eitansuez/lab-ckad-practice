Welcome.

This workshop is a port of Liptan Biswas' excellent [CKAD practice challenge](https://www.katacoda.com/liptanbiswas/courses/ckad-practice-challenges).

The idea is to provide access to environments in which to practice for the CKAD exam.

## Notes

- The environment variable DR has been set.  It examples to `--dry-run=client -oyaml` and is provided for convenience.  Feel free to make use of it.
- Similar to the katacoda workshop, each section has a verification script that can be run to see validate your solutions.  The name of the verification script is provided at the end of a section's instructions.
